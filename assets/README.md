## Refactor Web Marketing Challenge 01

## Description
This project was an exercise to enhance an existing webpage by consodilating elements in HTML and adjusting the CSS properties. The updates to the code are meant to provide increased accessabilty and readabilty for future collaborators. During the process of refactoring I had the opportunity to apply newly aquired skills in HTML semantic layout, and CSS styling techniques.

## Usage
The webpage has internal links to specific information about the Web Marketing Company, click the links to explore content details.

## Tests
Google developer Mode can be used to get a closer look at semantic flow and styles used. I used Google Screen reader extension to check for accessabilty and fluency.
